00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,850
Located off of the East Coast of the United
States is one of the worldâ€™s most powerful

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,380
current systems, the Gulf Stream. It distributes
a large amount of warm water from the Gulf

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,550
of Mexico and Caribbean Sea northward to
the North Atlantic Ocean.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,280
Data from Earth-orbiting satellites equipped
with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,800
can be used to determine sea surface temperatures.
In this false-color image, red and orange

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,480
colors indicate warm ocean water, while blue
and purple indicate colder water. The Gulf

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Stream is visible as a sinuous band of red,
wrapping around the southern tip of Florida,

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,039
moving up the eastern seaboard where it
changes color to yellow and then flows into

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,420
the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,920
The position of the Gulf Stream varies once
it passes Cape Hatteras North Carolina. In

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,429
this simplified map view, the Gulf Stream
can be seen changing its position and wiggling

12
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:02,429
around in a snake-like fashion. These fluctuations
create curving loops of water known as meanders,

13
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,370
similar to those seen in the shapes of streams
on land.

14
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,540
The ocean transfers heat in a similar fashion
as our atmosphere, through something akin

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,690
to storms. These ocean storms are known as
eddies. The Gulf Stream produces eddies that

16
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,710
spin off of the primary current path and move
heat outward. Eddies can either have a cold

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:29,110
core, where the water at its center is cold,
or a warm core, where there is warm water

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,000
at its center.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,540
Eddies are formed when rings are pinched off
as the Gulf Stream meanders. The direction

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,290
that the eddy pinches off determines whether
it has a cold core or a warm core. If the

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:47,090
eddy pinches off into the warm water to the
south, cold water is captured at its core.

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,870
On the other hand, if the eddy pinches off
into the colder water to the north, it captures

23
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,410
warm water at its core. These eddies sometimes
last for several months, providing a unique

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,080
ecosystem for marine life. Eventually, the
eddies dissipate into the surrounding water,

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,350
or, in some cases, they rejoin the Gulf Stream.

26
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,719
The Gulf Stream moves an impressive amount
of water and heat into the northern latitudes.

27
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,400
As it does so, it directly affects weather
and climate patterns over the entire globe.
